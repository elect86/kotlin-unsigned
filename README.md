Unsigned operators and boxed types (`Ubyte`, `Uint`, `Ulong` and `Ushort`) for unsigned support.

To have a quick idea what this library offers, take a look at the [tests](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/kotlin-unsigned/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/unsigned/test.kt)

### Differences with kotlin stdlib: 

- this project uses classes instead inline classes. To address this in critical scenarios where allocations may have a sensitive impact, primitive variable holding the utype value is a `var`, so you can re-use the same istance over and over again
- utypes extend `Number` abstract class
- automatic conversions
- it is possible to string format by calling the corresponding `format()` method, eg: `ubyte.format("%08x")`
- all the utypes implement all the function, including `shl` and `shr` for `Ubyte` and `Ushort`
- if you add an `Ushort` to another `Ushort` you get an `Ushort` (and not an `Uint`)

### How to get it:

[Gradle](https://jitpack.io/#kotlin-graphics/kotlin-unsigned/v2.1)

- Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

      allprojects {
          repositories {
              ...
              maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // should be the last entry
          }
      }

- Add the dependency

      dependencies {
          compile 'com.github.kotlin-graphics:kotlin-unsigned:v2.1'
      }

[Maven, Sbt, Leiningen](https://jitpack.io/#kotlin-graphics/kotlin-unsigned/v2.1)


### Hightlights:

Android compatible, sources compiled with java 1.7.

All unsigned methods available for `int`s and `long`s on java 1.8 have been reported here. 

These are offered directly on the corresponding [`Int`](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/kotlin-unsigned/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/unsigned/java_1_7/int.kt) and [`Long`](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/kotlin-unsigned/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/unsigned/java_1_7/long.kt) Kotlin primitives (with `infix` too)
